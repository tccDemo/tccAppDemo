On March 16th 2017, Dean Jeremy Walsh passed away quietly, in his sleep. Over 23 years, Jeremy had served as Dean of the School of Education at Strata University. Dean Walsh will always be remembered for his cheerful and energetic lectures and his tendency to treat equally students and presidents alike. We send condolences to the Walsh family in this difficult time. <\/p>`, "shortDetail": " On March 16th 2017, Dean Jeremy Walsh passed away quietly, in his…", "title": "Dean Walsh passes away at age 82", "isNew": true, "priority": "5", "postedBy": "Anthony Ma", "postedAt": ""

Upon seeing news reports about water quality on college campuses in other parts of the country, residence life staff at Strata University asked the university’s environment, health and safety office to conduct sampling in our residence halls over spring break. These tests were done voluntarily and at our request.<\/span><\/p>\r\n

According to results received this week, most of the 90 locations that were sampled were found to have no lead present. However, initial samples taken in two locations at Strata did exceed the EPA’s regulatory limit (“threshold level”). It is important to note that those samples were taken after the water had been sitting idle in the distribution system during winter break, when the presence of contaminants would likely be elevated. Second samples taken at the same locations after running the faucets showed significantly lower levels. In fact, lead was no longer detectable at one of the locations. In the second location, the sample was below “threshold level” but above “action level,” which is not a violation of drinking water standards.<\/p>\r\n

Although there is no immediate health threat, we are asking students to take precautions while we collect another set of samples and determine what additional steps should be taken.<\/p>\r\n

Your health and safety are of utmost importance to us, we are grateful to our professionals in residence life and environment, health and safety for proactively taking steps to ensure the quality of our water.<\/p>`,
